# Cad-TMVP

This study used data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (http://adni.loni.usc.edu/). ADNI was established in 2003 to investigate the use of MRI, PET, and other measures to track the progression of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Researchers can access data by registering and agreeing to the ADNI data use agreement on the website. The other cancer omics can be obtained from the referred paper in our manuscript.
